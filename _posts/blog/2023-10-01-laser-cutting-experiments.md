This week, I have been experimenting with laser cutting. I wanted to continue incorporating computational thinking into my process, so the first thing I thought of was to create a p5.js sketch for the laser cutter. Although raster files can be used for etching, I think it would be more interesting to generate a vector path for the laser cutter.

After some research, I found [an open-source project](https://github.com/zenozeng/p5.js-svg) that provides a SVG runtime for p5.js. In order to use it in a p5.js project, first include `<script src="https://unpkg.com/p5.js-svg@1.5.1"></script>` in the index.html file.

Then specify SVG as the renderer in `createCanvas()`.

Now, everything we draw in p5.js will be rendered as an SVG element.

After some initial experiments with the SVG runtime, I decided to test it out with one of my old sketches, which could convert any reference image to a drawing formed by scribbles (in the sketch below, the reference image is a QR code). To my surprise, it worked right away after doing the steps above.

I did not yet find any easy way to export the sketch as a SVG file, instead, I grabbed the SVG code directly from the web inspector and pasted it into a blank .svg file. That way, I could do some final edits in Adobe Illustrator.

In Adobe Illustrator, I resized the scribble (yes, singular, because it was a single continous scribble) and fitted it onto a 2.125 x 2.125 inch square with rounded corners, which was the short side of a credit card.

Below is a timelapse of the engraving process:

    </video>
  </th></tr></thead>
  <tbody><tr style="text-align: center;"><th></th></tr></tbody>
</table>

Then I did some more tests with other old sketches. One was a flowery design formed by repeated sprial patterns.

Another one was the same scribble sketch with a self-portrait as the input.

Here are all the small tests I did:

Finally, moving to a design for a larger piece. I decided to use the self-portrait and add more a bit more details to it.

In Adobe Illustrator, I separated the outline and the scribble into two layers.

I sent engraving and cutting as two separate jobs to the Epilog Laser Engraver.

Here is a timelapse of the whole process, which took about half an hour:

<table style="width: 100%;">
  <thead><tr><th>
    <video controls width="100%" preload="auto" poster="">
      <source src="/media{{ page.url }}IMG_9401.mp4" type='video/mp4'>
    </video>
  </th></tr></thead>
  <tbody><tr style="text-align: center;"><th>
  </th></tr></tbody>
</table>

Here is the final result:
